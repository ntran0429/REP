## Problem Statement

This report/dashboard serves as a guide for a foreign investor looking to invest into the US rental market, particularly multiple-unit properties (duplex, triplex, etc.).

**Potential Extra Features**
* Homebuyer: recommend states/cities to live based on personal preferences
* House price prediction

## Context

### Investor's Requirements

* Fund: $500,000 cash
* Ideal states: no particular preference
* Property types: duplex, triplex, quadplex, condo, townhouse
* Investment strategies: **long-term**, mid-term, **house hacking**
* Define the best state(s): cashflow (cash on cash return) and property quality
* Deliverables: recommended areas with reasons, within each recommended state

### Business Question

1. What are the best states/areas to invest in the US rental market?
2. Once identified a state, which metro areas / neighborhoods are best to invest?

### Frame the Business Problem into a Data Question

* What are the states/areas that currently deliver the best cashflow and property quality?
	+ **Cashflow is gauged by supply & demand (employment, resources, location)**
	+ **Property quality is measured by property value over time**
* What are the most likely states/areas to deliver the best cashflow and property quality over the next 5 years? (analytical and predictive)
	+ **Migration trends:** rate at which people are moving in, factors for movers
	+ **Economic and housing:** employment, growing or stable job market?, resources, property value over time, supply: # rental properties available, demand: # people looking to rent
	+ **Quality of life:** resources, crime rates, education quality (average school rating), quality of care ([average hospital safety grade rating](https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/search?findBy=state&zip_code=&city=&state_prov=TX&hospital=))
	+ **Policy and regulation:** favorable tax policies for investors (effective property tax rate)?, incentives for real estate development, government planning, Landlord-Tenant Laws (efficiency of eviction procedures, tenant rights and investor protections)

### Components to Answer the Question

These are the factors that determine the "best" state for rental property investing

#### Migration Trends

* Can we predict the next up and coming inbound and outbound states?
* Where are people leaving from and going to?
* What are the factors driving people away from, or towards, a certain location?
* What are the effects of state to state migration and how does it affect the country as a whole?

#### Economic and Housing Analysis

* State GDP growth
* Employment rates
* Housing analysis
	+ Analyze factors influencing housing market trends
	+ High or low homeownership rates
	+ Cashflow vs property quality
	+ How to find quality tenants?

#### Social Trend / Quality of Life

* Resources, business headquarters

#### Policy and Regulation



## Progress Made

There will be a dashboard with multiple other report pages to get into the details of the analysis.
Some of the report pages include Migration Trends, Housing Analysis, Quality of Life, Policy and Regulation, etc.

I'm almost done with the Migration Trends page. Here's my work in progress:

The next and final report page is Housing Analysis, where the investor can drill down into each state and its respective metro areas with important metrics that help her determine which area to invest into.
